Three Guessing Game Modes
=========================

Child-Guess
-----------
-The child guesses the apps secret number.
-The child can only see each card once in a sequence.
-Each card shows a 'Yes/No' comment from the app letting the child know if the App's secret number is on the card or not.
-After all cards have been seen, the child has one chance to guess the number correctly.
-If the child guessed correctly, the score details are added to the high-scores.

App-Guess
---------
-The app guesses the child's secret number.
-The child can swipe between any of the cards in any sequence.
-Each card has a 'Yes/No' button so the child can tell if the App's secret number is on the card.
-After all 'Yes/No' selections have been made by the child, the app guesses the number.
-If the app won, the score is recorded into the high-scores table.

Free-Play
---------
-No Scoring.
-The child is allowed to swipe between any of the cards.
-'Yes/No' information is not provided.
